# ComputerVision-MiniProjects
A collection of computer vision mini projects using Python and OpenCV

This repository contains my **OpenCV learning journey** — I explored computer vision basics, color detection, contours, hand tracking, virtual painting, and more.

Here you’ll find mini projects I built while practicing concepts step by step.

Each project has:
- Its own folder
- Its own `README.md` with instructions
- Clean and simple code to learn from
